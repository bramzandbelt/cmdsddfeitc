How to use
----------

This repository is organized as an R package, called `cmdsddfeitc`. The R package structure was used to help manage dependencies, to take advantage of continuous integration for automated code testing and documentation, and to be able to follow a standard format for file organization. The package `cmdsddfeitc` depends on other R packages and non-R programs, which are listed below under [Dependencies](#Dependencies).

To download the package source as you see it on GitHub, for offline browsing, use this line at the shell prompt (assuming you have Git installed on your computer):

Install `cmdsddfeitc` package from Github:

-   From R:

        devtools::install_github("bramzandbelt/cmdsddfeitc")

-   From the command line:

        git clone https://github.com/bramzandbelt/cmdsddfeitc.git

Once the download is complete, open the file `cmdsddfeitc.Rproj` in RStudio to begin working with the package and compendium files. To reproduce all analyses, run the shell script `analysis/bash/run_all_analyses.sh`. This will run all RMarkdown notebooks in correct order. Note, however, that this will *not* reproduce the computational modeling analyses performed in the document `03_computational_modeling_analysis.Rmd`), only the result of the optimizations. This is because optimization of all 708 models (59 participants (defer-speedup, N = 28; date-delay, N = 31), 6 parameterizations, 2 architectures) was done on a computer cluster and would take simply too long to run on a regular computer. In order to reproduce the computational modeling analyses, run `03_computational_modeling_analysis.Rmd` as a parameterized report with argument `optimize=TRUE`.

### Parameterization of analysis notebooks

The analyses can be customized, by specifying a number of parameters. Below is an overview of the parameters that can be set and the notebooks in which they are used.

-   `participant_id`: the participant identifier (ranging from 1 to 93);
-   `task`: the task from which to process the data:
-   `defer_speedup`: intertemporal choice task with neutral, defer, and speedup frames;
-   `date_delay`: intertemporal choice task with delay and date frames;
-   `visualize`: whether or not to visualize the results (e.g. set to `FALSE` when fitting the model to the data);
-   `optimize`: whether or not to optimize the parameter values (i.e. set to `FALSE` when only visualizing the data);
-   `pars_from_file`: whether to use parameter values stored on disk (i.e. set to `TRUE` when visualizing the data)
-   `algorithm`: specification of the optimization algorithm:
-   `DEoptim`: differential evolution algorithm with (lower and upper) bound constraints;
-   `DEoptimR`: differential evolution algorithm with (lower and upper) bound and nonlinear constraints (i.e. ensuring that P(LL choice|SS amount = 0) &gt; 0.75 and P(LL choice| SS amount = LL amount) &lt; 0.25);
-   `model_name`: name of the model class to fit to the data, can be any of the following:
-   `DDM`: Drift-diffusion model (fits choices and response times);
-   `DFT_CRT`: Decision field theory (fits choices and response times);
-   `DFT_C`: Decision field theory (fits choices only);
-   `parameterization`: name of the parameterization to fit to the data:
-   `time_scaling`: lets `\kappa` parameter of the time function vary between frames;
-   `value_scaling`: lets `\mu` parameter of the value function vary between frames;
-   `time_and_value_scaling`: lets `\kappa` parameter of the time function and `\mu` parameter of the value function vary between frames;
-   `time_scaling_t0`: lets `\kappa` parameter of the time function and non-decision time (`t0`) vary between frames;
-   `value_scaling_t0`: lets `\mu` parameter of the value function and non-decision time (`t0`) vary between frames;
-   `time_and_value_scaling_t0`: lets `\kappa` parameter of the time function, `\mu` parameter of the value function, and non-decision time (`t0`) vary between frames;
-   `bound_setting`: controls the lower and upper bounds on the model parameters:
-   `standard`: uses parameter bounds specified in the preregistration document;
-   `wide`: uses wider parameter bounds, allowing parameters values to account for 'reverse' framing effects (e.g. more LL choices for delay than date frames);
-   `max_iter`: maximum iterations performed before optimization algorithm stops;
-   `rel_tol`: tolerance of the optimization algorithm's stopping criterion;
-   `n_pop_per_free_param`: number of population members per free parameter (see `NP` in `DEoptimR::JDEoptim` and `DEoptim::DEoptim.control`).

These parameter are used in the following analysis notebooks (indicated by their number only)
