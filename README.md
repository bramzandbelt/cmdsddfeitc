Overview
--------

The packagae `cmdsddfeitc` is a research compendium of the research project *Cognitive Mechanisms of the Defer-Speedup and Date-Delay Framing Effects in Intertemporal Choice* by Bram Zandbelt. This project was conducted at the Donders Institute, Radboud University / Radboucumc, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and registered at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging under project number (DCCN PI: Roshan Cools).

The `R/` directory contains:

-   R code specific to the present project; functions are organized into files (e.g. functions for plotting are in `plot_functions.R`)

The `analysis/` directory contains:

-   R Markdown notebooks implementing the analyses (`notebook_templates/` directory), numbered in the order in which they should be run;
-   shell scripts running the R Markdown notebooks with appropriate parameters, if any (`bash/` directory).

The `data/` directory contains:

-   the raw performance data (`raw/` directory);
-   the data derived from the raw data (`derivatives/` directory), organized by notebook name.

The `documents/` directory contains:

-   documents describing the content of the experimental data (`content/` directory), such as codebooks;
-   documents describing the context of the data (`context/` directory), such as ethics documents, data management plan, and preregistration;
-   documents related to the report of this research project (`manuscript/` directory).

The `figures/` directory contains:

-   visualizations of descriptive and inferential statistics, organized by notebook name.

The `man/` directory contains:

-   documentation of objects inside the package, generated by `roxygen2`.

The `packrat/` directory contains:

-   R packages the research compendium depends on; for more info see <https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/>.

The `reports/` directory contains:

-   static HTML versions of the knitted R Markdown notebooks, organized by notebook name.

Finally, this research compendium is associated with a number of online objects, including:

How to use
----------

This repository is organized as an R package, called `cmdsddfeitc`. The R package structure was used to help manage dependencies, to take advantage of continuous integration for automated code testing and documentation, and to be able to follow a standard format for file organization. The package `cmdsddfeitc` depends on other R packages and non-R programs, which are listed below under [Dependencies](#Dependencies).

To download the package source as you see it on GitHub, for offline browsing, use this line at the shell prompt (assuming you have Git installed on your computer):

Install `cmdsddfeitc` package from Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("bramzandbelt/cmdsddfeitc")
```

Once the download is complete, open the file `cmdsddfeitc.Rproj` in RStudio to begin working with the package and compendium files. To reproduce all analyses, run the shell script `analysis/bash/run_all_analyses.sh`. This will run all RMarkdown notebooks in correct order. Note, however, that this will *not* reproduce the computational modeling analyses performed in the document `03_computational_modeling_analysis.Rmd`), only the result of the optimizations. This is because optimization of all 708 models (59 participants (defer-speedup, N = 28; date-delay, N = 31), 6 parameterizations, 2 architectures) was done on a computer cluster and would take simply too long to run. In order to reproduce the computational modeling analyses, run `03_computational_modeling_analysis.Rmd` as a parameterized report with argument `optimize=TRUE`.

Packrat takes care of dependencies.

Model optimization (notebook) was performed in R 3.5.1. on the Donders Institute computer cluster.
